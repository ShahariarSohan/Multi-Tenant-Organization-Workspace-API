# Multi-Tenant Organization Workspace API

## Project Overview

The **Multi-Tenant Organization Workspace API** is a secure, scalable REST API designed to support multiple client organizations within a single platform.  
Each organization operates in **strict isolation**, with its own users, projects, and tasks, ensuring enterprise-grade data security and authorization.

This system follows **real-world SaaS architecture principles**, including role-based access control (RBAC), service-layer authorization, and database-level integrity enforcement.

## Live API URL (Hosted)

**Base URL:** [https://multi-tenant-organization-workspace-iota.vercel.app](https://multi-tenant-organization-workspace-iota.vercel.app)

> ⚠️ All APIs in the Postman collection are configured using this hosted URL.  
> No localhost setup is required for testing.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- JWT Authentication
- Zod Validation
- Bcrypt

## Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL was chosen because:

- Strong **relational integrity** using foreign keys and constraints
- Excellent support for **multi-tenant relational data**
- ACID compliance ensures **data consistency**
- Scales well for real-world SaaS platforms
- Prisma provides **type-safe queries** and migration control

Given strict rules such as:
- Tasks cannot cross organizations
- Users belong to exactly one organization
- Projects belong to one organization

A relational database is the **most professional and reliable choice**.
